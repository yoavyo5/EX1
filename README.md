======== Dijkstra's algorithm ========

Team:  Dvir pradelsky, Oz rubinstein, Yםשה Sיןנן.

This project focuses on finding the shortest route (like navigation app), and find the shortest path that doesn't run in the black list of points.

The project tested graphs in different sizes.
For finding the shortest route use Dijkstra's algorithm.
in addition in this project we ar chacking Diamiter, Radius and The triangle inequality.


Here is explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

For blacklist we need to check which valid vertex.
If a vertex is invalid to change the weight attached to infinite so that no algorithm will take the cost of the vertex is connected to this account and will give you the shortest route no break the blacklist.

Directories in our project are: java.io.File - Reading and writing files in Java (Input/Output) – Tutorial. java.io.IOException - IOException signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations. java.util.HashMap - Java class HashMap(java.util.HashMap) is a fast and easy to use class representing hash table, a data structure that associates keys with values. java.util.Map - A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value. It models the mathematical function abstraction. java.util.NavigableSet - A SortedSet extended with navigation methods reporting closest matches for given search targets. Methods lower, floor, ceiling, and higher return elements respectively less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal, and greater than a given element, returning null if there is no such element. A NavigableSet may be accessed and traversed in either ascending or descending order. java.util.Scanner - Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type. java.util.TreeSet - A NavigableSet implementation based on a TreeMap. The elements are ordered using their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at set creation time, depending on which constructor is used.
